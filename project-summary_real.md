 
 A WEB BASED WORD PRESS SOLUTION

A Three tier architecture

For this project i created one Aws Ec2_instances of Ubuntu version 20.04 distribution with all the configurations for free tier set up and it was meant
to house the database server. while i also created three Red Hat Ec2 instance while i named the three of them web 1, web 2 and web3 all partitioned.


In this project i demonstrated the power of three tier architecture showing that there can be communication between three servers all meant to do different
things on the same project but with a common objective of making sure the WordPress website is displayed and the project did just that at the end of the project.
WordPress was installed while connecting MYSQL database server engine remotely, this will further my skills set at deploying a web-based solutions that is database driven.


This no doubt will further enhance my understandings of the critical components of the web solutions and the capacity needed to troubleshoot
while making progress in my development in the Devops landscape.
